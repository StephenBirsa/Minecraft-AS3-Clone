# Background
Started this project originally as a port of Notch's JavaScript Minecraft render test/jsfiddle (Which was a port of Minecraft4K limited in JavaScript) on the web into Flash ActionScript 3.0.
Eventually added the movement vectors and camera rotation code to be able to move around.
Progressed to making it similar to Minecraft's Indev stage of Development but with less implemented and eventually moved on to other projects (and left ActionScript 3.0).
